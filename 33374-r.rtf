Because of it, even though she had normal-looking brown eyes (or so she was told), she wore sunglasses to protect her retinas.\par \tab There are a hundred million rods in a human eye, and seven million cones, Kuroda\rquote s email had said. The retina processes the signals from them, compressing the data by a ratio of more than 100:1 to travel along 1.2 million axons in the optic nerve. Kuroda felt that Caitlin having Tomasevic\rquote s syndrome was a sign that the data was being misencoded by her retinas. Although her brain\rquote s pretectal nucleus, which controlled pupil contraction, could glean some information from her retinal datastream (albeit getting it backward!), her primary visual cortex couldn\rquote t make any sense of it.\par \tab Or, at least, that\rquote s what he hoped was the case, since he\rquote d developed a signal-processing device that he believed could correct the retinal coding errors. But if Caitlin\rquote s optic nerves were damaged, or her visual cortex was stunted from lack of use, just doing that wouldn\rquote t be enough.\par \tab And so Caitlin and her parents had learned the ins and outs of the Canadian health-care system. To assess the chances of success, Dr. Kuroda had wanted her to have MRI scans of specific parts of her brain (\u8220\'d2the optic chiasma,\u8221\'d3 \u8220\'d2Brodmann area 17,\u8221\'d3 and a slew of other things she\rquote d never known she had).

And in early 2008, of course, many of the procedures were tested here as we dealt with the Tibet situation.\u8221\'d3 He paused. \u8220\'d2Now, yes, any attempt to shut down the Web }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid3018824 within}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3018824  China would be difficult; thousands of ISPs would have to be blocked.

Fundamentally, the rest of the world doesn\rquote t care what happens to the Chinese people, least of all to our poorest citizens. They have always turned a blind eye to what happens within our borders, so long as they can shop cheaply at their Wal-Marts. They will move on to other things soon enough.\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2Tian\emdash \u8221\'d3 Zhang stopped himself, the allusion that was never made by others in these contexts stillborn on his lips.\par \tab But the president nodded. \u8220\'d2That was different; those were students. Our actions there were the same as those of the Americans at Kent State and a hundred other places. The Westerners saw themselves in what we did, and it was their own self-loathing they transferred to us. But rural peasants? There is no connection. There may be vitriol for a short time, but it will die down because they will realize that our actions have helped make them\emdash the Westerners\emdash safe. Meanwhile, we will present a more palatable story to our people; I will leave preparing that in your capable hands. But if word does get out during the most sensitive period, when the incident is fresh, I don\rquote t want a distorted Western view of it being reflected back into this country.\u8221\'d3\par \tab Zhang nodded. \u8220\'d2Very well. Still, the Changcheng Strategy will have its own repercussions.\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2Yes,\u8221\'d3 said the president. \u8220\'d2I know.

Life will go on.\u8221\'d3 A pause. \u8220\'d2But, yes, there will be needs for international electronic cash transfers\emdash the Americans servicing their debts to us, for instance. We can keep certain key channels open, of course, but nonetheless a short interruption is doubtless best.\u8221\'d3\par \tab The president swiveled his chair, his back now to Zhang, and he looked out the other window, at the slanted roofs of the Forbidden City, the silver sky shimmering overhead.\par \tab His country\rquote s rapidly increasing prosperity had been a joy to behold, and it was, he knew, thanks to his policies. In a few more decades, peasant villages like the ones in question would be gone anyway; China would be the richest country in the world. Yes, there would always be foreign trade, but by the end of this century there would be no more \u8220\'d2developing world,\u8221\'d3 no cheap labor here\emdash or anywhere else\emdash for foreigners to use. Raising the level of prosperity in the People\rquote s Republic meant that China would eventually be able to go back to what it had always been, back to the roots of its strength: an isolated nation with purity of thought and purpose. This would simply be a small taste of that, an appetizer for things to come.\par \tab Zhang said, \u8220\'d2When are you going to give the order to implement Changcheng?\u8221\'d3\par \tab The president turned to look at him, eyebrows raised. \u8220\'d2Me?

Not to mention relying on shoddy equipment\emdash now, if they\rquote d just buy more Japanese hardware. Speaking of which\~...\u8221\'d3\par \tab He handed Caitlin the eyePod, and she immediately started feeling it all over with her fingers. The unit was longer now. An extension had been added to the bottom and it was held on with what felt like duct tape; it }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid3018824 was}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3018824  a prototype after all. But the extension had the same width and thickness as the original unit, so the whole thing was still a rectangular block. It was substantially larger than Caitlin\rquote s iPod\emdash she had an old screenless version of the iPod Shuffle, since an LCD didn\rquote t do her any good. But it wasn\rquote t much bigger than Bashira\rquote s iPhone, although the unit Dr. Kuroda had built had sharp right angles instead of the rounded corners of Apple\rquote s devices.\par \tab \u8220\'d2Okay,\u8221\'d3 said Kuroda. \u8220\'d2I think I explained before that the eyePod is always in communication with your post-retinal implant via a Bluetooth 4.0 connection, right?\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2Yes,\u8221\'d3 said Caitlin, and \u8220\'d2Right,\u8221\'d3 added her mom.\par \tab \u8220\'d2But now we\rquote ve added another layer of communication. That module I attached to the end of the eyePod is the Wi-Fi pack. It\rquote ll find any available connection and use it to transmit to me copies of the input and output datastreams\emdash your raw retinal feed, and that feed as corrected by the eyePod\rquote s software.\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2That sounds like a lot of data,\u8221\'d3 Caitlin said.\par \tab \u8220\'d2Not as much as you\rquote d think. Remember, your nervous system uses slow chemical signaling. The main part of the retinal data signal\emdash the acute portion produced by the fovea\emdash amounts to only 0.5 megabits per second. Even Bluetooth 3.0 could handle a thousand times that rate.\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2Ah,\u8221\'d3 said Caitlin, and perhaps her mom nodded.\par \tab \u8220\'d2Now, there\rquote s a switch on the side of the unit\emdash feel it. No, farther down. Right, that\rquote s it. It lets you select between three communication modes: duplex, simplex, and off. In duplex mode, there\rquote s two-way data transmission: copies of your retinal signals and the corrected datastream come here, and new software from here can be sent to you. But, of course, it\rquote s not good security to leave an incoming channel open: the eyePod communicates with your post-retinal implant, after all, and we wouldn\rquote t want people hacking into your brain.\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2Goodness!\u8221\'d3 said Mom.\par \tab \u8220\'d2Sorry,\u8221\'d3 said Kuroda, but there was humor in his voice. \u8220\'d2Anyway, so if you press the switch, it toggles over to simplex mode\emdash in which the eyePod sends signals here but doesn\rquote t receive anything back. Do that now. Hear that low-pitched beep? That means it\rquote s in simplex. Press the switch again\emdash that high-pitched beep means it\rquote s in duplex.\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2All right,\u8221\'d3 said Caitlin.\par \tab \u8220\'d2And, to turn it off altogether, just press and hold the switch for five seconds; same thing to turn it back on.\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2Okay.\u8221\'d3\par \tab \u8220\'d2And, um, don\rquote t lose the unit, please. The University has it insured for two hundred million yen, but, frankly, it\rquote s pretty much irreplaceable, in that if it\rquote s lost my bosses will gladly cash the insurance check, but they\rquote ll never give me permission to take the time required to build a second unit\emdash not after this one has failed in their eyes.\u8221\'d3\par \tab }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid3018824 It\rquote s failed in my eye, too,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3018824  Caitlin thought\emdash but then she realized that Dr. Kuroda must be even more disappointed than she was. After all, she was no worse off than before coming to Japan\emdash well, except for the shiner, and that would at least give her an interesting story to tell at school. In fact, she was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid3018824 better}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3018824  off now, because the eyePod was making her pupils contract properly\emdash she\rquote d be able to kiss the dark glasses good-bye. Kuroda was now boosting the signal her implant was sending down her left optic nerve so that it overrode the still-incorrect signal her right retina was producing.\par \tab But he had devoted months, if not years, to this project, and had little to show for it. He had to be bitterly upset and, she realized, it }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid3018824 was}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3018824  a big gamble on his part to let her take the equipment back to Canada.\par \tab \u8220\'d2Anyway,\u8221\'d3 he said, \u8220\'d2you work on it from your end: let that brilliant brain of yours try to make sense of the signals it\rquote s getting.

But that wasn\rquote t worthy of note, apparently.\par \tab She sighed and decided, since she was here, to see if Wikipedia had an entry on }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid3018824 The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3018824  It did, sort of: the book\rquote s title redirected to an entry on \u8220\'d2Bicameralism (psychology).\u8221\'d3\par \tab For Caitlin, the most interesting part of Jaynes\rquote s book so far had been his analysis of the differences between the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid3018824 Iliad}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3018824  and the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid3018824 Odyssey.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3018824  Both were commonly attributed to Homer, who\rquote d supposedly been blind\emdash a fact that intrigued her, although she knew they probably weren\rquote t really both composed by the same person.\par \tab The }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid3018824 Iliad,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3018824  as she\rquote d noted before, featured flat characters that were simply pushed around, following orders they heard as voices from the gods. They did things without thinking about them, and never referred to themselves or their inner mental states.\par \tab But the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid3018824 Odyssey}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3018824 \emdash composed perhaps a hundred years after the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid3018824 Iliad}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3018824 \emdash had real people in it, with introspective psychology. Jaynes argued that this was far more than just a shift in the kind of narrative that was in vogue. Rather, he said that sometime in between the composing of the two epics there had been a breakdown of bicameralism, precipitated perhaps by catastrophic events requiring mass migrations and the resulting ramping up of societal complexity. Regardless of what caused it, though, the outcome was a realization that the voices being heard were from one\rquote s own self. That had given rise to modern consciousness, and a \u8220\'d2soul dawn,\u8221\'d3 to use Helen Keller\rquote s term, for the entire human race.\par \tab Nor were the Greek epics Jaynes\rquote s only example. He also talked about the oldest parts of the Old Testament, including the book of Amos, from the eighth century B.C., which was devoid of any internal reflection, and about the mindless actions of Abraham, who\rquote d been willing to sacrifice his own son without a second thought because God, apparently, had told him to do so. Jaynes contrasted these with the later stories, including Ecclesiastes, which dealt with, as Mrs. Zed kept saying all good literature should, the human heart in conflict with itself: the inner struggle of fully self-aware people to do the right thing.\par \tab The Wikipedia entry was essentially correct, as far as Caitlin could tell from the portion of the book she\rquote d read so far, but she did reword a couple of the sentences to make them clearer.\par \tab Her computer started bleeping, an alarm she\rquote d set earlier going off quite loudly through the earphones.\par \tab Excitedly, she took off her headset, rotated her chair to face the window, and }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid3018824 looked}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3018824  as hard as she could\~...\page \par \par }\pard\plain \ltrpar\s16\qc \li0\ri0\keep\keepn\nowidctlpar\wrapdefault\hyphpar0\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 \rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af1\afs36\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f141\fs48\lang1033\langfe1033\kerning16\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af1 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3018824 Chapter 10\par \par }\pard\plain \ltrpar\s15\ql \li0\ri0\sl360\slmult1\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx4752\wrapdefault\hyphpar0\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24\alang1033 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\kerning16\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3018824 \tab Straining to perceive.

No change. No new flash of light\emdash nor any dimming of what she was already seeing.\par \tab And then she was hit by a thought that should have already occurred to her.

The lights, the lines, the colors were all still there. Her heart fell. Whatever she was seeing had no relation to external reality; no wonder she hadn\rquote t been able to recognize the window frame. She opened and closed her eyes a couple more times, just to be sure, and flicked the room light on and off (or perhaps off and on!) a few more times, as well.\par \tab Caitlin slowly made her way back to her bed and sat on its edge. She\rquote d felt momentarily dizzy as she crossed the room, distracted by the lights, and she lay down, her face pointing up at the ceiling she\rquote d never seen.\par \tab She tried to make sense of what she was seeing.

And although she still didn\rquote t know if she was in the dark or in a brightly lit room, as time passed she did seem to be seeing increasing amounts of detail\emdash a finer and more complex filigree of crisscrossing colored lines.
